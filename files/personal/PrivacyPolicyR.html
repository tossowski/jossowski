<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Protecting Your Privacy</span><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">The author, Oscar Seurat, is committed to
protecting your privacy when you visit this website.&nbsp;
No personally identifiable information about you is collected here unless you voluntarily provide it. <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This document explains
what kind information is collected when you browse these pages. Please keep in mind that depending on the
Internet traffic and the interest this website receives, its content
may change leading to changes in this privacy policy. You are,
therefore, encouraged to refer to this policy regularly<br>
<ol style="font-weight: bold;">
<li>Two cases when the information is collected.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You browse these pages without entering any personally identifiable
information.</span>
</div>
<div style="height: 7px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;In this case, the author
does not collect any personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp; Certain information pertaining to your session is collected automatically to better understand the traffic loads and security of this website. The
collected non-personally identifiable
items are the following:<br>
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">i) the IP address of the
visitor<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">ii) the date and time of
the visit<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">iii) the domain name
associated with the IP address (e.g. if you access this website from
your&nbsp; school&#8217;s computer, we will collect the domain name
&#8220;yourschool.com&#8221;; if you do so from your company&#8217;s computer ,&nbsp;
the collected domain name will be &#8220;yourcompany.com&#8221;)<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">iv) the browser you
accessed this website with together with its software version<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">v) the operating system of
your computer and its version<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">vi) the urls you accessed
while browsing&nbsp; this site<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">vii) If you access
SudokuStories.com from a mobile or other device, we may collect a
unique device identifier assigned to that device ("UDID"), geolocation
data, or other transactional information for that device.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Collecting this type of
information is very common; for example, The New York Times. The Wall
Street Journal, NASA.gov and many&nbsp;other major
websites&nbsp;log some or all of the above items at the present
time.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You voluntarily provide personally identifiable information.</span><br>
</div>
<div style="height: 7px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This situation occurs only
if you choose to send the author feedback via the "Comment" link. The e-mail address and any other
 information provided by the visitor will be retained in order to better serve them in the future.<br>
</div>

<ol style="font-weight: bold;" start="2">
<li>How the information is used.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The information collected

denial of service attacks, gaining an unauthorized entry, and other

extent of the law.&nbsp; Additional data collection may occur,
therefore, in connection with stopping

<ol style="font-weight: bold;" start="4">
<li>Retention of Information.</li>
