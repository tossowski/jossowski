reviews or scholarly analysis. This restriction includes, but is not
limited to, public dissemination of any puzzle design derived from this
work by a reordering of the digits 1 through 9 and applying the
resulting mapping to the entries of any puzzle in this volume. For
example, following the reversed order of digits: 9, 8, 7, ..., 2, 1,
and mapping a grid&#8217;s 1s into 9s, 2s into 8s, 3s into 7s, and so on,
produces a derived grid which, in terms of its relationship with the
original, is analogous to a mirror image of an elaborate blueprint and
cannot be considered as original work. Application of any such trivial
mappings for the purpose of deriving a new design constitutes protected
use of this work and is subject to the above restrictions.</div>
