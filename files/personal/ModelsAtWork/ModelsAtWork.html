New York being the world's advertising capital, it is only natural that from time to time one runs into models working on the street. I took this picture while walking to the 39th street ferry after work one evening. There’s usually very few people along the West Street’s eastern side; no shopping malls, no public transportation; far from everywhere. Quite likely the very reason for the photographer’s choice of the place.

The face of the woman on the left seems recognizable. Isn’t she on the cover of every second fashion magazine? The few photos I took provided a minute of respite and made me recall a truly fitting <a href= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20158831?uid=3739256&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21102059776857>passage</a> from Ian McEvan’s ‘Dead as They Come’.

I run into this trio of a photographer (the man), a makeup artist (the woman in a yellow hat), and a model in the West Village while on my way to NYU library. Parking is difficult in the City, so I often leave the car on West Street, and walk to Washington Square Park on foot. There’s always something interesting to spot while crossing the Village; even on a Saturday morning with few people around.

The makeup artist springs up to make a correction--the image must be perfect. Looking at the model, I am thinking about the cookie I have just eaten, one she’s most likely not allowed to indulge, and the workout she must do today that I can easily skip. Far worse is probably some younger woman, a competitor, who, thanks to a random quirk in her features, may be <em>the</em> woman of the next photo-shoot.
