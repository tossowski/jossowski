The main pretext for this opportunity to visit China was the International Conference on Machine Learning. It took place in a hotel near Beijing's Olympic Village and among the many topics discussed was algorithmic trading ...

There is something magical about any large space or structure. Take a look at this huge broad walk in Beijing's Olympic Village. The lamp posts, the two towers, and the 'Bird's Nest' &mdash; the Olympic track & field stadium &mdash; would not look out of place on the Starfleet Academy grounds.

The iconic Tienanmen Square view of the Forbidden City &mdash; the residence of Chinese emperors for 6 centuries. Looking at this entrance gate (with the last emperor's image above the center door:-) one does not have an inkling about the City's size. Once inside, though, it quickly becomes clear that the Beijing monarchs did not think small ...

Another layer of the imperial residence. Only people of rank were allowed to come here (hence the 'Forbidden City'). Pacing around the courtyards, one can't help the feeling that only the very few privileged could actually see the emperor. He always seems to weigh the matters of life and death in the City's next perimeter. Not surprisingly, given my low rank, I did not see His Highness either ...

The Forbidden City's austere courtyards and buildings could tire even the monarchs. Hence the emperors rested in the Summer Palace &mdash; a complex of tranquil lakes, bridges and parks about 7 miles from the City.

Taking this bus is probably the best way to see the Great Wall, i.e., with the ordinary Chinese. The only problem is that you would have to know Chinese. In addition, you might get fooled by tens of other unofficial buses in the area which charge much more, but offer worse service. The most expensive are the tours directly from the hotel &mdash; they cost 10x the price for the (reasonable) bus we took from here.

		   Again, I hoped that one could run a 5-miler on the winding Great Wall. Too many people, of course, but perhaps in the off-season? I wonder whether they organize the races similar to those in the Empire State Building, where you run by the stairs from the ground level to the 103rd floor ...

That the terrain was particularly difficult for projects like the Great Wall is very clear from this picture. Yet, once the emperor said that there would be a wall, that was the way it had to be.

My flight through the “corridor” is nearing the end. In a moment I will turn left (west) and cross the Hudson to return to Coldwell, NJ, 10 miles away.  &nbsp;&#x2666;&nbsp; One of the things which have changed in the City since I took this flight is the dramatic increase in use of bicycles. Last spring and summer (2012), I made a few bicycle trips across George Washington Bridge myself (fun!). On a couple of occasions I was able to compete with the vehicular traffic which was slowed down by traffic jams. Here, in 2009, one can’t see a single bicycle on the pedestrian pathways at the edges of the Bridge. The gridlock, however, is the same ...

We realized very quickly that we were being taken advantage of by taxi drivers. Instead of direct route to the destination, they would drive us around to bump up the meter reading. Hence we soon found our way to Beijing subway and never looked back again. Yes, it could be crowded during the traffic rush, but for me it was a better experience than taking the subway in New York, London or Paris. Short waits, and clean and air-conditioned (!) platforms.
