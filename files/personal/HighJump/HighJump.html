This picture of our track team was taken in Warsaw in 1986. There are four high jumpers here; the two people standing on the right (I am the shorter athlete), and the two people standing to the right of our coach, Roman Wszola (far left, with a stopwatch). The other teammates were mainly middle distance runners. The true significance of this image is that the second person from the left is the <strong>Olympic champion in high jump from 1976, Jacek Wszola</strong> (our coach's son). Jacek Wszola's personal best of 235cm (7 ft & 8.52 in) would earn him a silver medal even in 2012 and was clearly beyond our reach. My personal best was 'only' 206cm (6 ft & 9.1 in) while Adam Kolwicz's (the shorter jumper standing next to Jacek) 217cm (7 ft & 1.4 in).

You can see me here attempting to clear what looks like 200cm (6 ft & 6.7 in). I believe this picture was taken in 1988 or 1989, in Lodz, where I won a meet with that result. Even though, having to move to other things, I no longer had the time for 'make it or break it' practice (in fact, experts will notice that I am committing a minor technical error in this jump), my generally active life-style allowed me to clear reasonable heights for about 2 years. Unfortunately, in those days bringing a camera to a practice or even a competition seemed a major nuisance (digital cameras were still a glimmer in their inventors' eyes). It was easier to jump 200cm than to develop a picture, and one always thought that he could take that picture on the next day. Hence the pictures of my best jumps were never taken.

In the metric world, jumping  2m (6 ft & 6.7 in) is a magical threshold. Unless one has an exceptional, Olympic caliber talent (which I did not), a great deal of work is needed to attain that level. Even world champions cross this distinct barrier only once in their athletic career. Once on the 'other' side, a high jumper's results start looking 'professional'; in a layman's eye they may pass as those of a champion (it is easier to confuse 2.06m with 2.16m, than, say, 1.96m with 2.06). Alas, even though I enjoyed the experience, getting there was not easy. You can see me here performing two-footed 'hops' over hurdles at their highest setting. This picture was taken in my hometown in northern Poland. Click on the image for a larger version <em>(to return to this page you will need to press the 'Back' button).</em>"
