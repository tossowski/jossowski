<h3 style = "color: grey">Possible Updates to this Document</h2>
<span style = "color: grey">Excluding materials for purchase and the instructor, syllabus information may be subject to  change. The most up-to-date syllabus is located within the course in HuskyCT.</span>


<h2>Required Textbook </h2>
<a href = "https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/fullbook.pdf"><em>A First Course on Data Structures in Python</em></a> by Donald R. Sheehy (free)<br>
(you can also obtain this book from its <a href = "https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures">Github repo</a>)
<br><br>



<p>

	<!--
<strong> Note: Both books are on reserve for CS5800 at Quinn Library (Lincoln Center) with 3 hours loans.
  Additional readings will be distributed through out the course.</br>
</strong>
	-->

  <h2>Minimum Technical Skills</h2>
  To be successful in this course, you will need the following technical skills:
  <ul>
  <li>Install python and third party packages (like Matplotlib) on your local computer</li>
 <li>Use a terminal on your local computer (Linux, MacOS, Windows)</li>
 <li> Write and run python programs on your local computer</li>
</ul>




<h2>Course Description and Objectives</h2>

By the end of the semester, students should be able to: 
<ul>
 <li> Write programs in python using imports, functions, and object-oriented programming.</li>
 <li> Compare data structures and algorithms based on time and space complexity and choose the correct ones for a given problem.</li>
<li>Implement abstract data types (stacks, queues, deques, mappings, priority queues) using various data structures (lists, linked lists, doubly linked lists, heaps, trees, graphs) and algorithms.</li> 
 <li>Use recursive algorithms to solve problems</li>
</ul>



      <h2>Attendance and Class Participation </h2>
      The current plan is to hold this class remotely for the first two weeks, and in-person afterwards depending on the Covid situation. When the
      course is held remotely please enter HuskyCT's  Collaborate Ultra area and join the session scheduled for the given lecture's time.
      Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance (or Husky CT will do that automatically if a class session is given remotely).
      Attendance will account for 5% of your final grade (you will be allowed 3 unexcused absences). There will be weekly
      small (10 min) pop-quizzes which will account for the next 5% of the grade. The worst quiz will be dropped. Please actively participate
       in class since this will make the course more interesting for everyone. Ask questions if you are unsure about something.

<h2>Labs</h2>
 Labs are relatively straight-forward programming exercises on Mimir intended given you an opportunity to practice and assymilate the material
 that you have just heard on the lecture. You will work on the lab assingments in random pairs so that you can practice collaboration and sharing of 
 ideas. The basic bluprint of this hands-on collaboration is that one person writes the code while the other makes the suggestions. Every 15 minutes
 the roles change. Often the lab assignment will need to be finished after the lab session ends and you will do that at home
 individually. The pairs
 will be random and announced shortly before the lab session. Labs will account for 10% of the final grade. The worst lab score will be dropped.
Labs will become available on Mondays every week and will be due the following Sunday.
 <h2>Homework</h2>
    
	   Homework will consist of weekly substantive programming assignments that are  more challenging and require more time than the labs.
     As a result, homework will account for 25% of your final grade. As with the labs, you will need to submit your work to Mimir.
     These assignments will be posted on Wednesdays and due in a week from the posting. The worst assignment will be dropped.

     NOTE:
     <ul>
     <li> No late homework or lab assignments will be accepted 1 day past the due date. You will be allowed to submit your work at most 1 day late N times
       in the semester with no penalty.
        The number N is set generously to 5, and is implemented as "5 late tokens" on Mimir.</li>
     <li> Dispute on grading must be resolved within two weeks after receiving your scores.</li>
     </ul>

<!--
<h2>Course Project</h2>
<p>There will be a course project. The project can be completed either individually or as a group (strongly recommended). <strong>A group can have at most 4 people</strong>.
More details will be discussed in class.
	</p>


    <h2>Course Project</h2>

    <p>We will be working on a course project to predict diabetic patients' readmissions after being discharged from the hospitals. You will be exploring a real world dataset which represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
    The project can be completed either individually or as a group. If you choose to form a group, your group can have at most 5 people.
    More details will be discussed in Lecture 2.
    </p>
-->
    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>We will have one midterm exam which will account for 25%  of your final grade. </li>
    <li>
    Exams will pen-and-paper unless the class is held remotely at the time of the exam due to the Covid pandemic. 
    </li>
        <li>
No  make-up exams will be given after an exam's date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid failing it. In case of illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    <li><span style="color: magenta"><strong>FINAL EXAM.</strong></span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The final exam will be cumulative with emphasis on the material covered after midterm.
          </li>
          <li>
            In accordance with UConn policy, students are required to be available for their final exam and/or complete any assessment during the time stated. If you have a conflict with this time you must obtain official permission to schedule a make-up exam with the Office of Student Support and Advo- cacy (OSSA). If permission is granted, OSSA will notify the instructor. Please note that vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading the assessment schedule, and oversleeping are not viable reasons for rescheduling a final.

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

      All homework assignments must be completed individually. It is okay for you to discuss a problem with a classmate as long you abide by the following conditions:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Each student you collaborate with should be named on the written homework assignment.
      </li>
      <li>
	You must first consider each problem on your own and generate ideas on how to solve the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
	You may discuss problems and ideas jointly. The goal of collaboration is to understand the high level ideas of the problem. Do not go further than this.
      </li>
      <li>
	You must write solutions completely on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
	Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks and collaborators) to attempt to find the problem or the solution. This includes using the internet to search for parts of the problem.
      </li>
     </ul>
