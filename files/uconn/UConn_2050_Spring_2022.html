<h3 style = "color: grey">Possible Updates to this Document</h2>
<span style = "color: grey">Excluding materials for purchase and the instructor, syllabus information may be subject to  change. The most up-to-date syllabus is located within the course in HuskyCT.</span>


<h2>Required Textbook </h2>
<a href = "https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/fullbook.pdf"><em>A First Course on Data Structures in Python</em></a> by Donald R. Sheehy (free)<br>
(you can also obtain this book from its <a href = "https://github.com/donsheehy/datastructures">Github repo</a>)
<br><br>



<p>

	<!--
<strong> Note: Both books are on reserve for CS5800 at Quinn Library (Lincoln Center) with 3 hours loans.
  Additional readings will be distributed through out the course.</br>
</strong>
	-->

  <h2>Minimum Technical Skills</h2>
  To be successful in this course, you will need the following technical skills:
  <ul>
  <li>Install python and third party packages (like Matplotlib) on your local computer</li>
 <li>Use a terminal on your local computer (Linux, MacOS, Windows)</li>
 <li> Write and run python programs on your local computer</li>
</ul>




<h2>Course Description and Objectives</h2>

By the end of the semester, students should be able to: 
<ul>
 <li> Write programs in python using imports, functions, and object-oriented programming.</li>
 <li> Compare data structures and algorithms based on time and space complexity and choose the correct ones for a given problem.</li>
<li>Implement abstract data types (stacks, queues, deques, mappings, priority queues) using various data structures (lists, linked lists, doubly linked lists, heaps, trees, graphs) and algorithms.</li> 
 <li>Use recursive algorithms to solve problems</li>
</ul>



      <h2>Attendance and Class Participation </h2>
      This class will be held remotely for the first two weeks, and in-person afterwards (depending on the Covid situation). When the
      course is held remotely please enter HuskyCT's  Collaborate Ultra area and join the session scheduled for the given lecture's time.
      Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance (or Husky CT will do that automatically if a class session is given remotely).
      Attendance will account for 5% of your final grade (you will be allowed 3 unexcused absences). There will be weekly
      small (10 min) pop-quizzes which will account for the next 5% of the grade. The worst quiz will be dropped. Please actively participate
       in class since this will make the course more interesting for everyone. Ask questions if you are unsure about something.

<h2>Labs</h2>
 Labs are relatively straight-forward programming exercises on Mimir (stay tuned for announcements about joining our Mimir class). These exercises are intended to give you an opportunity to practice and assymilate the material
 that you have just heard on the lecture. You will work on the lab assingments in random pairs so that you can practice collaboration and sharing of 
 ideas. The basic blueprint of this hands-on collaboration is that one person writes the code while the other makes the suggestions. Every 15 minutes
 the roles change. Often the lab assignment will need to be finished after the lab session ends, and you will do that at home
 individually. The pairs
 will be random and announced shortly before the lab session. Labs will account for 10% of the final grade. The worst lab score will be dropped.
Labs will become available on Mondays every week and will be due the following Sunday.
 <h2>Homework</h2>
    
	   Homework will consist of weekly substantive programming assignments that are  more challenging and require more time than the labs.
     As a result, homework will account for 25% of your final grade. As with the labs, you will need to submit your work to Mimir.
     These assignments will be posted on Wednesdays and due in a week from the posting. The worst assignment will be dropped.

     NOTE:
     <ul>
     <li> No late homework or lab assignments will be accepted 1 day past the due date. You will be allowed to submit your work at most 1 day late N times
       in the semester with no penalty.
        The number N is set generously to 5, and is implemented as "5 late tokens" on Mimir.</li>
     <li> Dispute on grading must be resolved within two weeks after receiving your scores.</li>
     </ul>

<!--
<h2>Course Project</h2>
<p>There will be a course project. The project can be completed either individually or as a group (strongly recommended). <strong>A group can have at most 4 people</strong>.
More details will be discussed in class.
	</p>


    <h2>Course Project</h2>

    <p>We will be working on a course project to predict diabetic patients' readmissions after being discharged from the hospitals. You will be exploring a real world dataset which represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
    The project can be completed either individually or as a group. If you choose to form a group, your group can have at most 5 people.
    More details will be discussed in Lecture 2.
    </p>
-->
    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>We will have one midterm exam which will account for 25%  of your final grade. </li>
    <li>
    Exams will be pen-and-paper unless the class is held remotely at the time of the exam due to the Covid pandemic. 
    </li>
        <li>
No  make-up exams will be given after an exam's date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid failing it. In case of illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    <li><span style="color: magenta"><strong>FINAL EXAM.</strong></span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The final exam will be cumulative with emphasis on the material covered after midterm. It account for 30% of your grade.
          </li>
          <li>
            In accordance with UConn policy, students are required to be available for their final exam and/or complete any assessment during the time stated. If you have a conflict with this time you must obtain official permission to schedule a make-up exam with the Office of Student Support and Advo- cacy (OSSA). If permission is granted, OSSA will notify the instructor. Please note that vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading the assessment schedule, and oversleeping are not viable reasons for rescheduling a final.

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet.</li>
    <li>If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.</li>
    <li>Discord provides a convenient way to meet remotely. Hence while the class is given in the remote modality,
      I will hold my office hours in a voice channel "Office Hours" on Discord (stay tuned for updates).</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height: 0px"></div>

    <h2> Hardware and Technical Requirements </h2>
    The hardware/technical requirements for this course include:
    <ul>
      <li>
      Computer with (<a href= "https://remotework.uconn.edu/equipment-recommendations/">per university requirements</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
    Dedicated access to high-speed internet with a minimum speed of 1.5 Mbps (4 Mbps or higher is recommended).
      </li>
    <li>
       Webcam (for proctoring during remote exams)
    </li>

    <li>
      Microphone (a working microphone in your computer is fine)
   </li>
    <li>
      Respondus Lockdown Browser (if exams are held remotely)
    </li>
    <li>
      If exams are held remotely, it will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">your</span> responsibility to ensure that all the involved technology works as expected (i.e., your computer, internet, webcam, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fortunately, all students I gave a remote exam to in the past were able solve all their technical issues. Being able to set up the equipment needed for remote learning and
      assure that it works properly has become a prerequisite of academic coursework.

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
This course expects all students to act in accordance with the Guidelines for Academic Integrity at the University of Connecticut. If you have questions about academic integrity or intellectual property, you should consult with your instructor. Additionally, consult UConn’s <a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a">guidelines for academic integrity</a>.
The collaboration policy described above is designed to allow students the resources to succeed while ensuring they learn and master the material. If you are unsure if something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, talk to me!
Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the Academic Integrity Hearing Board. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>jointly writing solutions</li>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions from other sources</li>
<li>sharing any code, including test cases, with classmates on homework assignments. Screen sharing code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing code.</li>
<li>unintentionally sharing code through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more code than you intend.
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
  note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li>
<li>cheating on the exams</li>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates before all grades are posted.
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
<li>violating the spirit of an assignment (e.g. using a series of if statements to pass test cases in Mimir)</li>
</ul>

We will use Stanford's MOSS (<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">privacy policy</a>), a tool developed to detect similarities in programming assignments, on all programming assignments.
