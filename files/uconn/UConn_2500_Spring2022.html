<h2>Course Description and Objectives</h2>

This course is an introduction to discrete mathematics and its application in computer
science. We will begin from basics describing sets and other elementary objects and work on both
mathematical techniques and proof skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Write clear, thorough, and precise proofs using logic. Determine whether an argument is logically sound.</li>
<li>Gain knowledge through formal reasoning and in particular, through the application of proof by contradiction.</li>
<li>Understand discrete mathematic concepts including functions and graphs. Analyze recurrence relations that arise in computer science.</li>
<li>Understand set theory and develop proofs of equality of sets and subset relationships using the element method of proof.</li>
<li>Apply counting principles to quickly understand the order of magnitude of a computing problem, or other related domain.</li>
<li>Understand and apply elementary probability concepts.
</ul>

      <h2>Attendance and Class Participation </h2>
      <ul>
   <li>Since it is important to attend every lecture, attendance will be monitored and account for 5% of your final grade.</li>
   <li>You will be allowed 3 unexcused absences during the semester.</li>
   <li>Please actively participate in class since this will make the course more interesting for everyone! Ask questions if you are unsure about something.</li>
   <li>This class may be conducted remotely during some periods of the semester due to the Covid pandemic. If that's the case, we will hold
   lecures in HuskyCT's Collaborate Ultra Course Room (on Tuesdays & Thursdays, 9:30am - 10:45am).
  </ul>
   
 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	There will two types of homework assignments: WebAssign problem sets given once a week, and 6 written assignments given approximately every 2 weeks.<br>
	</li>
      <li>
       WebAssign homework will be announced weekly on Thrusdays, the written homework on Tuesdays.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The written  assignments should be submitted on HuskyCT and should be typed using Microsoft Word or Latex. Manuscripts in
    longhand will be accepted only if they are neetly written. Penalties will be applied for illegibilty, and we reserve the
    right to reject papers that are  unacceptably messy.
	  </li>
    <!--<a href="a_schedule.htm"><strong>posted</strong></a> on the class website.-->
    <!--<a href="CSII_schedule.htm"><strong>posted</strong></a> with the class schedule on the class website.-->
    </li>
    <li>
      The binding due date of an assignment will be given on the assignment's statement. Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS2500_Schedule_Spring2022_html.htm">schedule</a>. 
      </li>
    <li>Each assignment will be graded with a scale of 100.
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="color: blue">No late homework will be accepted.</span> The worst WebAssign and written homework assignments will not count towards the final grade.
    </li>
</ul>
<!--
<h2>Course Project</h2>
<p>There will be a course project. The project can be completed either individually or as a group (strongly recommended). <strong>A group can have at most 4 people</strong>.
More details will be discussed in class.
	</p>


    <h2>Course Project</h2>

    <p>We will be working on a course project to predict diabetic patients' readmissions after being discharged from the hospitals. You will be exploring a real world dataset which represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
    The project can be completed either individually or as a group. If you choose to form a group, your group can have at most 5 people.
    More details will be discussed in Lecture 2.
    </p>
-->
    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>We will haveone midterm exam. </li>
    <li>
    There will be a final exam.
    The final exam is cumulative with emphasis on the material covered after midterm.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class pop-quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
      for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li> 
    <li>
    If the class is held in person, we will have pen-and-paper exams in our classroom. Otherwise, exams will be given remotely and their exact format will be announced later in the semester. 
    </li>
        <li>
No  make-up exams will be given after an exam's date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid failing it. In case of illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    <li><span style="color: magenta"><strong>FINAL EXAM.</strong></span>
In accordance with UConn policy, students are required to be available for their final exam and/or complete any assessment during the time stated. If you have a conflict with this time you must obtain official permission to schedule a make-up exam with the Office of Student Support and Advo- cacy (OSSA). If permission is granted, OSSA will notify the instructor. Please note that vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading the assessment schedule, and oversleeping are not viable reasons for rescheduling a final.

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>
   <ul>  
   <li>
    If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet.
   </li>
  
  <li>
    If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.
  </li>
    <li>
      Discord  must not be used for discussing actual solutions to particular homework or test problems before their due date (see the below sections about communication and collaboration)
          </li>
          </ul>



          <h2> Hardware and Technical Requirements </h2>
          The hardware/technical requirements for this course include:
          <ul>
            <li>
            Computer with (<a href= "https://remotework.uconn.edu/equipment-recommendations/">per university requirements</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
          Dedicated access to high-speed internet with a minimum speed of 1.5 Mbps (4 Mbps or higher is recommended).
            </li>
          <li>
             Webcam (for proctoring during remote exams)
          </li>
      
          <li>
            Microphone (a working microphone in your computer is fine)
         </li>
          <li>
            Respondus Lockdown Browser (if exams are held remotely)
          </li>
          <li>
            If exams are held remotely, it will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">your</span> responsibility to ensure that all the involved technology works as expected (i.e., your computer, internet, webcam, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fortunately, all students I gave a remote exam to in the past were able solve all their technical issues. Being able to set up the equipment needed for remote learning and
            assure that it works properly has become a prerequisite of academic coursework.

          <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      
            All homework assignments must be completed individually. It is okay for you to discuss a problem with a classmate as long you abide by the following conditions:
            <ul>
            <li>
              Each student you collaborate with should be named on the written homework assignment (or in a comment on top of a programming assigment).
            </li>
            <li>
        You must first consider each problem on your own and generate ideas on how to solve the problem.
            </li>
            <li>
        You may discuss problems and ideas jointly. The goal of collaboration is to understand the high level ideas of the problem. Do not go further than this.
            </li>
            <li>
        You must write solutions completely on your own.
            </li>
            <li>
        Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks and collaborators) to attempt to find the problem or the solution. This includes using the internet to search for parts of the problem.
            </li>
           </ul>
      
      <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
      This course expects all students to act in accordance with the Guidelines for Academic Integrity at the University of Connecticut.
