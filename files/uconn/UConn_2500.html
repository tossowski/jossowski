<h2>Textbook </h2>

<em> <b>Discrete Mathematics with Applications </b> </em> by Susanna
Epp, 5th edition </br>

<p>

	<!--
<strong> Note: Both books are on reserve for CS5800 at Quinn Library (Lincoln Center) with 3 hours loans.
  Additional readings will be distributed through out the course.</br>
</strong>
	-->
<h2>Course Description and Objectives</h2>

This course is an introduction to discrete mathematics and its application in computer
science. We will begin from basics describing sets and other elementary objects and work on both
mathematical techniques and proof skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
<ul>
  <li> Write clear, thorough, and precise proofs using logic. Determine whether an argument is logically sound.

 <li> Understand discrete mathematic concepts including functions and graphs.
<li> Analyze recurrence relations that arise in computer science.
</ul>

<h2>Attendance and Class Participation </h2>
   It is important to attend every class and lab session. We will use automatic check-in function of Blackboard. You have 30 minutes check-in window from the start of each class.
   Please actively participate in class since this will make the course more interesting for everyone! Ask questions if you are unsure about something.

 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
	   There will be 6-7 problem sets assignments over the course of
the semester. These assignments are to be submitted on HuskyCT and can be typed or handwritten.
For those with particularly messy handwriting, typing will probably save frustration between you and
the grader. Assignments will be graded no more than one week after they are due.

    <!--<a href="CSII_schedule.htm"><strong>posted</strong></a> with the class schedule on the class website.-->
    </li>
    <li>
    <b> All homework assignments must be submitted through HuskyCT whether typed or written. </b>
  </li>
    <li>
    Each assignment's due date is  <a href="CS2500_schedule.htm"><strong>posted</strong></a> on the schedule.
    </li>
    <li>Each assignment is graded with a scale of 100.
    </li>
</ul>
<!--
<h2>Course Project</h2>
<p>There will be a course project. The project can be completed either individually or as a group (strongly recommended). <strong>A group can have at most 4 people</strong>.
More details will be discussed in class.
	</p>


    <h2>Course Project</h2>

    <p>We will be working on a course project to predict diabetic patients' readmissions after being discharged from the hospitals. You will be exploring a real world dataset which represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
    The project can be completed either individually or as a group. If you choose to form a group, your group can have at most 5 people.
    More details will be discussed in Lecture 2.
    </p>
-->
    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be two midterm exams. </li>
    <li>
    There will be a final exam.
    The final exam is cumulative with emphasis on the material covered after midterm.
    </ul>


    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <!--  <li>Participation</a>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;10% (attendence + classroom participation)</li> -->
      <!--    <li>Attendance (Thursdays)</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%</li> -->
          <li>Homework:</a>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30%</li>
          <li>Midterm 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20%</li>
          <li>Midterm 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20%</li>
          <li>Final exam: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30%</li>
        </ul>
    <strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Note: </strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Failing to complete a HW on time will cause a 10% reduction for each additional day.</li>
    <li> Dispute on grading must be resolved within two weeks after receiving your scores.</li>
</ul>




    <h2>Additional Remarks</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></li><br>
      All work produced in this course should be your own unless it is specifically stated that you may work with others.
      You may discuss the homework problems with other students generally, but may not provide complete solutions
      to one another; copying of homework solutions is always unacceptable and will be considered a violation of
      Fordham's academic integrity policy. Violations of this policy will be handled in accordance with university
      policy which can include automatic failure of the assignment and/or failure of the course.
     For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/">Academic Integrity</a> website.

 <p>

      <li><strong>Makeup Exam </strong></li><br>
There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
