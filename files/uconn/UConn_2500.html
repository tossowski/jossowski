<h2>Course Description and Objectives</h2>

This course is an introduction to discrete mathematics and its application in computer
science. We will begin from basics describing sets and other elementary objects and work on both
mathematical techniques and proof skills. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Write clear, thorough, and precise proofs using logic. Determine whether an argument is logically sound.</li>
<li>Gain knowledge through formal reasoning and in particular, through the application of proof by contradiction.</li>
<li>Understand discrete mathematic concepts including functions and graphs. Analyze recurrence relations that arise in computer science.</li>
<li>Understand set theory and develop proofs of equality of sets and subset relationships using the element method of proof.</li>
<li>Apply counting principles to quickly understand the order of magnitude of a computing problem, or other related domain.</li>
<li>Understand and apply elementary probability concepts.
</ul>

      <h2>Attendance and Class Participation </h2>
   This class will be conducted remotely and will consist of lectures held in the HuskyCT Collaborate Ultra Course Room (on Tuesdays & Thursdays, 9:30am - 10:45am).
   Since it is important to attend every lecture, attendance will account for 5% of your final grade.  We will use the automatic check-in function of Blackboard. You have 30 minutes check-in window from the start of each class.
   Please actively participate in class since this will make the course more interesting for everyone! Ask questions if you are unsure about something.

 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	There will two types of homework assignments: WebAssign problem sets given once a week, and 5 written assignments given approximately every 3 weeks.<br>
	</li>
      <li>
       WebAssign homework will be announced weekly on Thrusdays, the written homework on Tuesdays.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The written  assignments should be submitted on HuskyCT and should be typed using Microsoft Word or Latex. Manuscripts in longhand will be accepted only if they are neetly written. Penalties will be applied for illegibilty, and we reserve the right to reject papers that are  unacceptably messy.

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

      All homework assignments must be completed individually. It is okay for you to discuss a problem with a classmate as long you abide by the following conditions:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Each student you collaborate with should be named on the written homework assignment.
      </li>
      <li>
	You must first consider each problem on your own and generate ideas on how to solve the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
	You may discuss problems and ideas jointly. The goal of collaboration is to understand the high level ideas of the problem. Do not go further than this.
      </li>
      <li>
	You must write solutions completely on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
	Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks and collaborators) to attempt to find the problem or the solution. This includes using the internet to search for parts of the problem.
      </li>
     </ul>
