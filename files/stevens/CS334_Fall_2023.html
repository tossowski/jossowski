	  identify intractable problems, understand the P vs. NP question.
	  </li>

</ul>

 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There will be 7 written and 3 programming assignments.</li>
    <li>
      The written assignments should be submitted to Canvas and must be typed using Latex or Microsoft Word. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Manuscripts written in longhand, submitted late or in a wrong place will not be accepted</span>.
    </li>
	<li>
          The programming assignments should be submitted to hackerrank.com. Details to follow.
	  </li>
	<li>
Using language models such as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">ChatGPT</span> to find partial or whole solutions, copying solutions in part or in whole from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Internet</span> or asking
 students not enrolled in the class  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">is strictly prohibited</span>.


	  </li>
      If you have any questions regarding your homework, test or quiz scores, <strong>you must address them within two weeks</strong> after those scores have been received. Scores more than two weeks old will not be reviewed. 
      </li>
    <li>
    The binding due date of an assignment will be given on the assignment's statement. Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS334_Schedule_Fall2023F.pdf">schedule</a>. 
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li>


    <!-- <li>
        We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
        for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li> 
    <li>
We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li>
    -->

    
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of an illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible. You will need to provide suitable documentation explaining your inability to take the exam. Depending on the credibility of the documentation (an e-mail from the affected student is not enough) arrangements will -- or will not -- be made for a makeup exam.
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance. You will be allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Attendance will account for 5% of
    your final grade.

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>

        
    If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet (see the "Software" section for setup).
    If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.
    

    <h2> Hardware and Technical Requirements </h2>
    The hardware/technical requirements for this course include:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Computer satisfying the following minimum technical requirements


<ul>
<li>In general, the device must be portable, sufficiently up to date, and have adequate memory and storage so that it can run the current version of its operating system</li>
<li>Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor (i7 or Ryzen 7 preferred)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM (16 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Mac OS 10.15 or Windows 10</li>
<li>256 GB SSD hard drive (512 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Wireless networking adapter</li>
<li>Camera and microphone</li>
</ul>
<br>

	
      </li>
      <li>
    Dedicated access to high-speed internet with a minimum speed of 1.5 Mbps (4 Mbps or higher is recommended).
      </li>
    <li>
       Webcam (for proctoring during remote exams)
    </li>

    <li>
      Microphone (a working microphone in your computer is fine)
   </li>
    <li>
      Respondus Lockdown Browser (if exams are held remotely)
    </li>
    <li>
      If exams are held remotely, it will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">your</span> responsibility to ensure that all the involved technology works as expected (i.e., your computer, internet, webcam, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fortunately, all students I gave a remote exam to in the past were able solve all their technical issues. Being able to set up the equipment needed for remote learning and
      assure that it works properly has become a prerequisite of academic coursework.

</ul>


    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

      All homework assignments must be completed individually. It is okay for you to discuss a problem with a classmate as long you abide by the following conditions:
      <ul>
      <li>
        Each student you collaborate with should be named on the written homework assignment (or in a comment on top of a programming assignment).
      </li>
      <li>
	You must first consider each problem on your own and generate ideas on how to solve the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
	You may discuss problems and ideas jointly. The goal of collaboration is to understand the high level ideas of the problem. Do not go further than this.
      </li>
      <li>
	You must write solutions completely on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
	Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks and collaborators) to find partial or whole homework/test problems' solutions. This includes using  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">language models or searching for whole or partial solutions on the Internet</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
       Posting the problems assigned in this course on the Internet (say, Reddit, Chegg, etc.) is not allowed.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <h2>Accommodation For Personal Circumstances including Religious Holidays</h2>

The course offers generous allowance for personal circumstances such as family events, religious holidays not observed by SIT, or other situations. You are allowed to miss three lectures without any impact on your participation score. Two worst written homework assignments and the worst programming assignment will be dropped at the end of the semester. Please plan accordingly in order not to deplete prematurely the course's allowance so that you can confine your special needs within the provided limits. No additional relief will be offered for the above reasons. Further accommodation may only be provided in cases of credibly documented illness, hospitalization, an accident, or similarly serious and unexpected situations.</p>
      
<div style="height:1px"></div>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Honor System</h3>
Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>.
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed.<br><br>
	  “I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.”
	  <br><br>
<h3>Reporting Honor System Violations</h3>
 Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations  <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>
<br><br>
The collaboration policy described above is designed to allow students the resources to succeed while ensuring they learn and master the material. If you are unsure whether something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, talk to me!
Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the appropriate school offices. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>not reporting collaborators</li>
  <li>jointly <span style="color: maroon">writing</span> solutions</li>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions in whole or in part from fellow students or other sources</li>
<li>screen sharing text/code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing the solution.</li>
<li>unintentionally sharing solutions through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more of the solution than you intended.
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
  note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code/text sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li>
<li>cheating on the exams</li>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates before all grades are posted.
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
</ul>

<!-- We will use Stanford's MOSS (<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">privacy policy</a>), a tool developed to detect similarities in programming assignments, on all programming assignments.> -->






 
<h2> Learning Accomodations</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services</a>. If you have any questions please contact: Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.

<h2>Inclusion Statement</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements.
You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.

<h2>Name And Pronoun Usage</h2>

As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes.


    <h2>Mental Health Resources</h2>

    Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health. While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health. The <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/counseling-and-psychological-services">Office of Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression). Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216- 5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.





    <h2>Emergency Information</h2>

    In the event of an urgent or emergent concern about the safety of yourself or someone else in the Stevens community, please immediately call the Stevens Campus Police at 201-216-5105 or their emergency line at 201-216-3911. These phone lines are staffed 24/7, year round. Other 24/7 resources for students dealing with mental health crises include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text “Home” to 741-741). If you are concerned about the wellbeing of another Stevens student, and the matter is not urgent or time sensitive, please email the CARE Team at care@stevens.edu. A member of the CARE Team will respond to your concern as soon as possible.

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    My lectures, notes, handouts, and displays are protected by state common law and federal copyright law. They are my own original expression. Students may take notes. In addition, students will be consulted before using their solutions either with or without their name.
