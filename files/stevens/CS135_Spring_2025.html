    <h2>Description of Course</h2>

    <p>

      This course forms an indicspensable foundation for any serious studies in Computer Science.  After successful completion, you will acquire the necessary vocabulary and toolkit of techniques that are used throughout the rest of the curriculum. In particular, you will able to perform the following tasks in each of the below areas:
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Formal logic</strong> – Prove validity of propositional formulas using truth tables, laws of logic, and the tree method.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Sets, Functions and Relations</strong> – Prove set identities using set-builder notation and laws of propositional logic.  Prove basic properties of functions (injective, surjective, bijective) and relations (reflexive, commutative, transitive) using logical reasoning. </li>
	
	<li><strong>Induction</strong> – Use inductive reasoning to solve problems and to prove properties of discrete structures and recursive programs.</li>
	  
	<li><strong>Scheme</strong> - Implement recursive functions over lists, relations, and numbers. In order to work with Scheme you will need to install DrRacket on your machine. See the <span style="color: rgb(100, 0, 255)">Software Requirements</span> section below.
	  </li>
	<li><strong>Number Theory</strong> – Define and prove properties such as primality and relative primality.  Implement Euclid’s algorithm to calculate gcds.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Modular Arithmetic</strong> – Define and prove properties of modular arithmetic, including Chinese Remaindering and Fermat’s Little Theorem.  Apply the theory to design and evaluate private- and public-key cryptographic systems.</li>
	
<li><strong>Graphs</strong> – Prove basic properties of trees, Eulerian cycles, and if time permits, planar graphs.</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <h2>Online Assignments</h2>
  <p>	Online assignments and their due dates will be posted on WebAssign. These assigments will account for 10% of your final grade.

    </p>


 <h2>Written Assignments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There will be 10 written homework assignments.</li>
    <li>
      The written assignments should be submitted to Canvas and should be typed using Microsoft Word, Latex or another word processor. Manuscripts in longhand will be accepted only if they are neetly written. Penalties <strong>will be applied</strong> for illegibilty, and we reserve the right to reject papers that are unacceptably messy. The students are responsible for checking that the uploaded submissions are complete (by, for example, downloading them back and verifying that the files are not corrupted).
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">No late homework will be accepted</span>.  <span style="color:rgb(100, 0, 255)">Assignments submitted on time in a wrong place will not be graded.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have any questions regarding your homework, test or quiz scores, <strong>you must address them within two weeks</strong> after those scores have been received. Scores more than two weeks old will not be reviewed. 
      </li>
    <li>
    The binding due date of an assignment will be posted weekly on Canvas. <!-- Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS334_Schedule_Fall2022.pdf">schedule</a>. -->
    </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Labs</h2>

    Another 10% of your grade will be based on Scheme programming exercieses. For that reason, as mentioned above, you will need to install DrRacket on your machine (as described in the <span style="color: rgb(100, 0, 255)">Software Requirements</span>). Lab assignments will be posted weekly shortly before lab sessions, and you will start working on them during labs. They will be due at 11:59 pm on the day of the lab or shortly thereafter. Details regarding submission of .rkt files will follow soon.








    



    

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li>
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a <strong>zero for that exam</strong>. In case of an illness/accident on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible and provide appropriate, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">credible documentation</span>,  so that suitable arrangements can be made. An e-mail from a student stating that they will miss an exam for an uncorroborated reason is not enough.
        </li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Since it is important to attend lectures and labs, we will be taking attendance. You will be allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Attendance will account for 5% of
    your final grade.

      </li>
      <li>
	You must write solutions completely on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
	Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks) to find partial or whole homework/test problems' solutions. This includes using  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">language models such as ChatGPT or searching for whole or partial solutions on the Internet</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
       Posting the problems assigned in this course on the Internet (say, Reddit, Chegg, etc.) is not allowed.

      <h2>Accommodation For Personal Circumstances including Religious Holidays</h2>

The course offers generous allowance for personal circumstances such as family events, religious holidays not observed by SIT, or other situations. You are allowed to miss three lectures without any impact on your participation score. Two worst written homework assignments, two lab assignments, and two online assignments will be dropped at the end of the semester. Please plan accordingly in order not to deplete prematurely the course's allowance so that you can confine your special needs within the provided limits. No additional relief will be offered for the above reasons. Further accommodation may only be provided in cases of credibly documented illness, hospitalization, an accident, or similarly serious and unexpected situations.</p>





<div style="height:1px"></div>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Honor System</h3>
Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found <a href="https://stevens.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2024-2025/academic-catalog/academic-integrity/honor-system-for-undergraduate-students/">online</a>.
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed.<br><br>
	  “I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.”
	  <br><br>
<h3>Reporting Honor System Violations</h3>
 Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations  <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>
<br><br>
The collaboration policy described above is designed to allow students the resources to succeed while ensuring they learn and master the material. If you are unsure whether something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, talk to me!
Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the appropriate school offices. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>jointly <span style="color: maroon">writing</span> solutions</li>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions in whole or in part from fellow students or other sources</li>
<li>screen sharing text/code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing the solution.</li>
<li>unintentionally sharing solutions through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more of the solution than you intended.
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
  note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code/text sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li>
<li>cheating on the exams</li>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates before all grades are posted.
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
</ul>

<!-- We will use Stanford's MOSS (<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">privacy policy</a>), a tool developed to detect similarities in programming assignments, on all programming assignments.> -->






 
<h2> Learning Accomodations</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services</a>.
