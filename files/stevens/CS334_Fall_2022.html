    <h2>Description of Course</h2>

    <p>


This course provides an introduction to models of computation and their languages. The topics covered are:  finite-state machines, non-determinism, regular languages, pushdown automata and context-free languages, Turing Machines and recursively enumerable languages. We will also study the limits of computability: The Church-Turing thesis, decidable languages, reducibility, the halting problem, and the recursion theorem. The semester will end with time and space complexity measures, intractable problems, and the P vs. NP question.



 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There will be 10 written homework assignments.</li>
    <li>
      The written assignments should be submitted to Canvas and should be typed using Microsoft Word or Latex. Manuscripts in longhand will be accepted only if they are neetly written. Penalties <strong>will be applied</strong> for illegibilty, and we reserve the right to reject papers that are unacceptably messy.
No late homework will be accepted.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have any questions regarding your homework, test or quiz scores, <strong>you must address them within two weeks</strong> after those scores have been received. Scores more than two weeks old will not be reviewed. 
      </li>
    <li>
    The binding due date of an assignment will be given on the assignment's statement. Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS334_Schedule_Fall2022.pdf">schedule</a>. 
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li>
    <li>
        We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
        for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li> 
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of an illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance. You will be allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Attendance will account for 5% of
    your final grade.


    <h2>Grading</h2>

      <tr>
        <td>Participation:</td>
 
        <td>5%</td>

        <td>In-class Quizzes:</td>

        <td>5%</td>

    <p>The worst two quizzes, two worst written assignments will not be counted towards your grade.</p>

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>

        
    If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet.
    If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.
    

    <h2> Hardware and Technical Requirements </h2>
    The hardware/technical requirements for this course include:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Computer satisfying the following minimum technical requrements


<ul>
<li>In general, the device must be portable, sufficiently up to date, and have adequate memory and storage so that it can run the current version of its operating system</li>
<li>Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor (i7 or Ryzen 7 preferred)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM (16 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Mac OS 10.15 or Windows 10</li>
<li>256 GB SSD hard drive (512 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Wireless networking adapter</li>
<li>Camera and microphone</li>
</ul>
<br>

	
      </li>
      <li>
    Dedicated access to high-speed internet with a minimum speed of 1.5 Mbps (4 Mbps or higher is recommended).
      </li>
    <li>
       Webcam (for proctoring during remote exams)
    </li>

    <li>
      Microphone (a working microphone in your computer is fine)
   </li>
    <li>
      Respondus Lockdown Browser (if exams are held remotely)
    </li>
    <li>
      If exams are held remotely, it will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">your</span> responsibility to ensure that all the involved technology works as expected (i.e., your computer, internet, webcam, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fortunately, all students I gave a remote exam to in the past were able solve all their technical issues. Being able to set up the equipment needed for remote learning and
      assure that it works properly has become a prerequisite of academic coursework.
    </li>
    </ul>
