    <h2>Description of Course</h2>

    <p>


This course provides an introduction to models of computation and their languages. The topics covered are:  finite-state machines, non-determinism, regular languages, pushdown automata and context-free languages, Turing Machines and recursively enumerable languages. We will also study the limits of computability: The Church-Turing thesis, decidable languages, reducibility, the halting problem, and the recursion theorem. The semester will end with time and space complexity measures, intractable problems, and the P vs. NP question.



 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There will be 10 written homework assignments.</li>
    <li>
      The written assignments should be submitted to Canvas and should be typed using Microsoft Word or Latex. Manuscripts in longhand will be accepted only if they are neetly written. Penalties <strong>will be applied</strong> for illegibilty, and we reserve the right to reject papers that are unacceptably messy.
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">No late homework will be accepted </span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have any questions regarding your homework, test or quiz scores, <strong>you must address them within two weeks</strong> after those scores have been received. Scores more than two weeks old will not be reviewed. 
      </li>
    <li>
    The binding due date of an assignment will be given on the assignment's statement. Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS334_Schedule_Fall2022.pdf">schedule</a>. 
    </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li>
    <li>
        We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
        for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li> 
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of an illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance. You will be allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Attendance will account for 5% of
    your final grade.

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>

        
    If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet (see the "Software" section for setup).
    If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Honor System</h3>
Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>.
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed.<br><br>
	  “I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.”
	  <br><br>
<h3>Reporting Honor System Violations</h3>
 Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations  <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>
<br><br>
The collaboration policy described above is designed to allow students the resources to succeed while ensuring they learn and master the material. If you are unsure whether something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, talk to me!
Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the appropriate school offices. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>not reporting collaborators</li>
  <li>jointly <span style="color: maroon">writing</span> solutions</li>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions in whole or in part from fellow students or other sources</li>
<li>screen sharing text/code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing the solution.</li>
<li>unintentionally sharing solutions through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more of the solution than you intended.
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
  note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code/text sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li>
<li>cheating on the exams</li>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates before all grades are posted.
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
</ul>

<!-- We will use Stanford's MOSS (<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">privacy policy</a>), a tool developed to detect similarities in programming assignments, on all programming assignments.> -->






 
<h2> Learning Accomodations</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services</a>. If you have any questions please contact: Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.

<h2>Inclusion Statement</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements.
You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.

<h2>Name And Pronoun Usage</h2>

As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes.


    <h2>Mental Health Resources</h2>

    Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health. While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health. The <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/counseling-and-psychological-services">Office of Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression). Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216- 5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.
