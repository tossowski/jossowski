    <h2>Description of Course</h2>

    <p>

      CS 570 a course on fundamental data structures and algorithms. We will explore this fascinating topic using the Java programming language and object oriented design. Our programs and exercises will work with lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables and more. In terms of algorithms, we will focus on searching and sorting as well as a general algorithmic paradigm, recursion. To assess an algorithm's performance we will learn how to apply the asymptotic complexity analysis. You will also practice how to apply the learned structures and algorithms to some interesting computational problems.</p>



    <h2> Homework</h2>
    There will be three types of homework assignments:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal">Participation Activities</span> -- these are sets of simple questions in zyBook textbook that you answer when reading the required sections. You will be allowed to attempt each question as many times as you like. To enhance your understanding of the material, you will be expected to complete these activities <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">before</span> the given module is formally covered in class.<br>
      <li> <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal">Challenge Activities</span> -- more serious zyBook activities that will require some thought and will be due a week after a given module has been covered.<br>
	  <li> <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: teal">Programming Assignments</span> -- 6 larger programming assignments that are independent of the textbook. You will have more than two weeks to complete those.
	   <li> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">No late homework will be accepted. </span>

	   <li> However, the worst two PAs and the worst two CAs will not count towards your final grade.
	   <li> Similarly. the worst programming homework will be disregarded.
	   <li>Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS570_Schedule_Fall2022.png">schedule</a>.
	   <li>In this course, the programming assignments are required to be completed individually. No collaboration is allowed.
	      
      </li>

	</ul>


    <h2>Exams</h2> 

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li>
    <li>
        We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
        for 5% of your final grade. The worst two quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester. <!-- They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. -->
    </li> 
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of an illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible, so that appropriate arrangements can be made.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Since it is important to attend lectures, I will be taking attendance. You will be allowed three unexcused absences during the semester. Attendance will account for 5% of
    your final grade.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Honor System</h3>
Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>.
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed.<br><br>
	  “I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.”
	  <br><br>
<h3>Reporting Honor System Violations</h3>
Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations  <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online</a>
<br><br>


<h2>Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity</h2>
<em>All Stevens graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. A student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student's own. All outside assistance must be acknowledged. Any student who violates this code or who knowingly assists another student in violating this code shall be subject to discipline.</em><br><br>
All graduate students are bound to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity by enrollment in graduate coursework at Stevens. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to understand and adhere to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity. More information including types of violations, the process for handling perceived violations, and types of sanctions can be found on  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/provost/graduate-academics">graduate academics site</a> .
<h2>Special Provisions for Undergraduate Students in 500-level Courses</h2>
The general provisions of the Stevens Honor System do not apply fully to graduate courses, 500 level or otherwise. Any student who wishes to report an undergraduate for a violation in a 500- level course shall submit the report to the Honor Board following the protocol for undergraduate courses, and an investigation will be conducted following the same process for an appeal on false accusation described in Section 8.04 of the Bylaws of the Honor System. Any student who wishes to report a graduate student may submit the report to the Dean of Graduate Academics or to the Honor Board, who will refer the report to the Dean. The Honor Board Chairman will give the Dean of Graduate Academics weekly updates on the progress of any casework relating to 500-level courses. For more information about the scope, penalties, and procedures pertaining to undergraduate students in 500-level courses, see Section 9 of the Bylaws of the Honor System document, located on the Honor Board website.






<br><br>
<h2>Specific Types of Violations</h2>
The collaboration policy described above is designed to allow students the resources to succeed while ensuring they learn and master the material. If you are unsure whether something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, talk to me!
Violations of this policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the appropriate school offices. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions in whole or in part from fellow students or other sources</li>
<li>screen sharing text/code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing the solution.</li>
<li>unintentionally sharing solutions through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more of the solution than you intended.
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
  note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code/text sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li>
<li>cheating on the exams</li>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates before all grades are posted.
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Learning Accomodations</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, visit <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services</a>.
