</ul>

 <h2>Homework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There will be 7 written and 3 programming assignments.</li><br>
    <li>
      The written assignments should be submitted to Canvas and must be typed using Latex or Microsoft Word. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Manuscripts written in longhand will not be accepted</span>. Students are responsible for making sure that the uploaded submissions are complete and not corrupted (for example, you could download your submission back to your computer and check that no corruption has occured). <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">No late homework will be accepted. Assignments submitted on time in a wrong place will not be graded.</span>
    </li><br>
	<li>
          The programming assignments should be submitted to hackerrank.com. Details to follow.
	  </li><br>
	<li>
Using language models such as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">ChatGPT</span> to find partial or whole solutions, copying solutions in part or in whole from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Internet</span> or asking
 students not enrolled in the class  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">is strictly prohibited</span>.


	</li><br>

	  <li>
      If you have any questions regarding your homework, test or quiz scores, <strong>you must address them within two weeks</strong> after those scores have been released. Scores more than two weeks old will not be reviewed. 
      </li> <br>
    <li>
    The binding due date of an assignment is the due date set on Canvas. Tentative due dates are listed on the course's approximate <a href="CS334_Schedule_Fall2024.pdf">schedule</a>. 
    </li><br>


      <li>

 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Posting</span>  statements of the problems assigned in this course or any partial or whole solutions to those problems on the Internet (say, Reddit, Chegg, Studoku, etc.) is strictly prohibited.


	</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Exams</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. </li><br>


    <!-- <li>
        We will have short (&le; 10 min) in-class quizzes testing whether you are following the basic concepts given in the lectures. Quizzes will account
        for 5% of your final grade. They will be given at most once a week and at least once per two weeks. </li>

    -->

    
    <li>There will be no make-up exams given after the exam date. If you know in advance that you will have to miss an exam, you must check with me (in advance) to avoid getting a zero for that exam. In case of an illness on an exam date, please contact me as soon as possible. You will need to provide credible documentation explaining your inability to take the exam. An e-mail from the affected student stating that they are unable to attend the exam is not enough. Depending on the credibility of the documentation, arrangements will -- or will not -- be made for a makeup exam.</li>
<br>
    <li>Note that if your average of the two exams  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">does not reach or exceed 45 out of 100</span>, you will not pass the course regardless of the scores on the other ingredients of the course (see the grading table below). </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>  Attending lectures in person is an important part of the learning process. Reading the textbook on your own or trying to learn the material primarily from other sources is in practice considerably more difficult than disciplined attendance of the lectures and completion of the course’s homework. In addition, seeing and interacting with your fellow students in person could be very valuable on its own as participating in a group effort is generally stimulating and it may lead to some beneficial serendipitous encounters or ideas. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Attendance via Zoom</span> (if available) does not have these benefits and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">will not count towards your attendance score. </span></li><br>
      <li>
	For that reason, I will take attendance within the first 15 minutes of every lecture. If you arrive after attendance has been taken, then your participating afterwards will not count towards your attendance score (even though attending could still be very beneficial).  The reason for this rule is that in our course we often follow a very defined train of thought where the next idea critically depends on the previous one. As a result, missing the starting part of this thought process will make it very difficult, and most likely impossible, for a late student to catch up. To learn the material, the student will have to re-read or re-watch the material, the remainder of the class being lost (and time is a precious resource). Another reason for this rule is to reduce the number of cases that occurred in the past where some students arrived at the end of a class and requested to be counted as present. Agreeing to that would be unfair to the students who made the effort to attend the lecture from the beginning.<br>
	  The goal of this policy is not to be overly meticulous about rules, but to encourage discipline which is very helpful in this challenging course. If you look closely, the policy is generous. Attendance counts for only 4% of the overall grade, and theoretically one can get a good grade even if they miss a substantial number of classes (however, in practice, missing classes is usually a symptom of other, bigger problems and those who miss a lot of classes invariably wind up with poor grades).</li>
	<br>
      <li>
	  In addition, our syllabus <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">allows a student to miss 3-lectures for any personal reason</span>  without any repercussions on the attendance score (please see the section on personal accommodation for  important details). This is to acknowledge that we’re all human and many things can happen during the semester that can reasonably make it difficult to make it to the class on time.

    <h2>Discord Discussion Forum</h2>

        
    If you have a question regarding the material or homework, chances are that somebody might have encountered that problem already. Check our Discord discussion forum first and post your question there if it has not been answered yet (see the "Software" section for setup).
    If you don't get the answer this way in a reasonable amount of time, (only then) you can ask me that question <em>outside</em> of my office hours. Naturally, you can ask me any question regarding the course <em>during</em> my office hours.
    

    <h2> Hardware and Technical Requirements </h2>
    The hardware/technical requirements for this course include:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Computer satisfying the following minimum technical requirements


<ul>
<li>In general, the device must be portable, sufficiently up to date, and have adequate memory and storage so that it can run the current version of its operating system</li>
<li>Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor (i7 or Ryzen 7 preferred)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM (16 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Mac OS 10.15 or Windows 10</li>
<li>256 GB SSD hard drive (512 GB preferred)</li>
<li>Wireless networking adapter</li>
<li>Camera and microphone</li>
</ul>
<br>

	
      </li>
      <li>
    Dedicated access to high-speed internet with a minimum speed of 1.5 Mbps (4 Mbps or higher is recommended).
      </li>
    <li>
       Webcam (for proctoring during remote exams)
    </li>

    <li>
      Microphone (a working microphone in your computer is fine)
   </li>
    <li>
      Respondus Lockdown Browser (if exams are held remotely)
    </li>
    <li>
      If exams are held remotely, it will be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">your</span> responsibility to ensure that all the involved technology works as expected (i.e., your computer, internet, webcam, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      Fortunately, all students I gave a remote exam to in the past were able solve all their technical issues. Being able to set up the equipment needed for remote learning and
      assure that it works properly has become a prerequisite of academic coursework.
    </li>
    </ul>
  
    <div style="height: 0px"></div>

   <h2>Software</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Canvas</u> (free) - Hosts all class materials and meetings. <br><span style="color:purple">Important note about Canvas:</span> the <em>automatic</em> calculations peforemed by Canvas should be disregarded. The only scores on Canvas that matter are those that I and the CAs enter manually for the assignmengts and tests. The automatic scores such as the running averages or grade forecasts  do not reflect our syllabus but are impossible to turn off. Hence for all intends and purposes they are just random noise.</li><br>
   
    <li><u>Discord</u> (free) - Communication platform for discussions. Use the Canvas link in the course navigation to join this class on Discord.   <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">When choosing your Discord name please give your full name so that I can confirm that you are enrolled in the class.</span><!-- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">&rarr; stay tuned for details</span></li> -->

    <h2> Communication</h2>
<ul> 
<li>The homework assignments, solutions, readings, and announcements will be posted on Canvas.</li><br>
<li>Please ensure that you can receive emails from Canvas so that you can get course announcements. However, please do not leave messages for me on Canvas as in a busy semester it is too troublesome to check messages in two places (the regular email, and Canvas). If you need to contact me about a personal issue, use my Stevens email address.</li><br>
<li>Discussions will take place on Discord. I will also answer questions on Discord, but I encourage students to try to answer questions jointly as well.</li><br>

<li><strong>Do not ask for or provide actual (or partial) solutions to homework problems on Discord.</strong></li><br>
<li>Personal questions should be sent directly to my email or handled in person during office hours.</li><br>
  <li> I will not answer emails from Friday 6pm to Monday 9am.</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Collaboration</h2>

      
      <li>
	All homework assignments must be completed individually. You must first consider homework/test/quiz problems on your own and generate ideas on how to solve them.
      </li><br>
      <li>
	You may discuss how to solve homework problems only at a high level, e.g., "I used such and such theorem", or "this chapter in the textbook handles a similar problem". Do not go further than this.
      </li><br>
      <li>
	<span style="color:purple">You must write solutions completely on your own without any help from others or a Large Language Model.</span>
      </li><br>
      <li>
	Do not use other resources (outside of your textbooks) to find partial or whole homework/test problems' solutions. This includes using  <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">language models or searching for solutions on the Internet</span>.
      </li><br>
      <li>
       <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Posting the problems assigned in this course</span> on the Internet (say, Reddit, Chegg, Studoku, etc.) is not allowed.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <h2>Accommodation For Personal Circumstances including Religious Holidays</h2>

The course offers allowance for personal circumstances such as family events, religious holidays not observed by SIT, or other situations. You are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">allowed to miss three lectures</span> without any impact on your participation score. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255)">Two worst written homework assignments and the worst programming assignment will be dropped</span> at the end of the semester. Please plan accordingly in order not to deplete prematurely the course's allowance so that you can confine your special needs within the provided limits. No additional relief will be offered for the above reasons. Further accommodation may only be provided in cases of credibly documented illness, hospitalization, an accident, or similarly serious and unexpected situations.</p>
      
<div style="height:1px"></div>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Honor System</h3>
Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found <a href="https://stevens.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2021-2022/academic-catalog/academic-integrity/honor-system-for-undergraduate-students/">online</a>.
The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work (including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed.<br><br>
	  “I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.”
	  <br><br>
<h3>Reporting Honor System Violations</h3>
 Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been committed should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations  <a href="http://web.stevens.edu/honor/">online.</a>
If you are unsure whether something is acceptable according to the collaboration policy, please talk to me.
Violations of our collaboration policy will be considered violations of the academic integrity policy and will be reported to the appropriate school offices. 
Consequences may include (but are not limited to) failure of the class. Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>jointly <span style="color: maroon">writing</span> solutions</li><br>
  <li>copying or plagiarizing solutions in whole or in part from fellow students or other sources such us language models or the Internet</li><br>
<li>screen sharing text/code on any platform (Discord, VS Code LiveShare, …) counts as sharing the solution.</li><br>
<li>unintentionally sharing solutions through platforms mentioned above, or sharing more of the solution than you intended.</li><br>
 <li>it is your responsibility to be mindful of who can access your files and which files they can access; 
   note that it may be easy for strangers to access voice channels on a Discord server and that many code/text sharing platforms (e.g. VS Code LiveShare)
   give participants access to all files and directories within the directory you share.</li> <br>
   <li>cheating on the exams by copying solutions from others or using your phones/tablets/computers while an exam is in progress</li><br>

     <li> appearing on the exam of an earlier section in order to gain advance information about test questions of your sections</li><br>
<li>discussing any information about exams with classmates in your or other sections while the exam of your or another section is still taking place</li><br>
<li>posting questions on forums like Reddit, StackOverflow, or Chegg. You can refer to previously posted questions on these forums, but not create new ones for this course.</li>
</ul>

<!-- We will use Stanford's MOSS (<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">privacy policy</a>), a tool developed to detect similarities in programming assignments, on all programming assignments.> -->






 
<h2> Learning Accomodations</h2>


Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The  <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/office-disability-services">Office of Disability Services</a> (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services.

    <h2>Mental Health Resources</h2>

    Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health. While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health. The <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/directory/counseling-and-psychological-services">Office of Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression). Appointments are strongly encouraged and can be made by phone (201-216- 5177) or in-person (on the 7th floor of the Howe Center). CAPS is open from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and from 9:00 am – 7:00 pm on Tuesdays during the Fall and Spring semesters.





    <h2>Emergency Information</h2>

    In the event of an urgent or emergent concern about the safety of yourself or someone else in the Stevens community, please immediately call the Stevens Campus Police at 201-216-5105 or their emergency line at 201-216-3911. These phone lines are staffed 24/7, year round. Other 24/7 resources for students dealing with mental health crises include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text “Home” to 741-741).
